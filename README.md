- Simple Text Twist Game -

This game is based on a small dictionary, which maps certain letter combinations to the words that can be formed from the combination.

Implemented using jQuery in front end code, php in back-end code, and AJAX is used to pass requests from front to back.

UI design and logic in both ends are accomplished... for now.

Functional updates can be done.

- Todo -

Add a shuffle botton to shuffle the rack to inspire players.

After game has ended, add bottons so that user can close or launch a new game.

Possibly change the way of guessing words from text input to clicking letters shown on the screen.
